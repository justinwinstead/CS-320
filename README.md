# CS-320: Software Test Automation &amp; QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by turning my requirements into an automated test suite. By pairing this with strong understanding of my code base, I can verify that there are few defects in my program. In addition, it is vital to understand where the points of risk are on your application to ensure that they are tested more rigorously. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Developers must maintain an outlet of communication to address the needs of their consumers and how those needs may change. I turn my user needs into functional and nonfunctional requirements that accurately describe the changes to the system that users desire. I can convert these requirements into a set of tests and use them to verify my program meets my users' needs. I develop the program based on these tests.

How do I approach designing software?

I design software with a cautious, test-driven approach. I ensure that requirements are met using a robust test suite that also meets statement coverage requirements. I understand that software developers have a duty to shield their consumers from risk. I actively work to prevent harm to my users.
